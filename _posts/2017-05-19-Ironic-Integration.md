excerpt: OpenStack bare metal provisioning a.k.a Ironic is an integrated OpenStack program which allows for flexible provisioning and allocation of bare metals to tenants. This post how Nuage Networks VSP extends these capabilities for flexible allocation to individual tenant subnets using the NuageNetworks 7850 VSG.

# Introduction
NuageNetworks allows for the flexible mapping of virtual machines and bare metal servers to tenant networks. Within an OpenStack environment, the Ironic project handles the management of bare metals. In this application note, the high level architecture and workflow will be described, followed by how you can setup the integration yourself and attach your own bare metal to an OpenStack Tenant subnet.

To demonstrate the integration Openstack Liberty (OSP8) will be used in combination with Nuage Networks VSP 4.0R8. Please check with your Nuage Networks sales representative if you are looking for another combination as this might impact the steps slightly.

# Architecture

## Target Domain Topology
The desired end goal is to model a couple of tenants that have a mixture of virtual machines and bare metals that are mapped into the same networking domain.

![Target Nuage Domain Topology][nuage-target-topology]
 
## Components involved
The components involved in this setup are shown below.

![Involved components in integrated Nuage-Ironic setup][ironic-nuage-components]


Our setup used in this application note has following components
* Nuage Networks Virtual Services Platform
  * VSD
  * Compute servers with VRS
  * 2 x 7850 Virtual Services Gateways, configured in a Redundancy Group
* OpenStack Ironic Controller, running all services related to the Openstack BareMetal service
* OpenStack controller, running all other OpenStack services

## Openstack Ironic Controller

The Ironic Controller in the setup hosts all services related to the Openstack Bare Metal service. It provides support to manage and provision physical machines. It includes following components:

* `ironic-api`:  RESTful API that processes application requests by sending them to the ironic-conductor over remote procedure call (RPC).
* `ironic-conductor`: Adds, edits or deletes nodes; powers on and off nodes with ipmi or ssh; provisions, deploys and cleans bare metal nodes. It includes a driver to interact with `ironic-python-agent`. In this note, the `pxe_ipmi` driver will be used.
* TFTP server for transferring boot disk images to the Bare Metal Node.
* DHCP server for assigning dynamic IP addresses during the initial provisioning process.

The `ironic-python-agent` is a small python application that is embedded in a ramdisk that is distributed to the node at the time of initial deployment or cleaning. The agent exposes a REST API that Ironic for handling actions such as inspect, configure, clean and deploy images. 
We will also be using `diskimage-builder` to help facilitate the creation of ramdisks and machine images, such as those running the `ironic-python-agent`.

Additionally, the Bare Metal service has certain external dependencies, which are very similar to other OpenStack services:
* A database to store hardware information and state. A simple approach is to use the same database back end as the Compute service. Another approach is to use a separate database back-end to further isolate bare metal resources (and associated metadata) from users. The latter approach is being utilized here.
* An oslo.messaging compatible queue, such as RabbitMQ. It uses the same implementation as that of the Compute service, but that is not a requirement.

### Network Connectivity of the Ironic Node

The Ironic controller has typically three network interfaces:
1. To access Nova/Glance/Neutron API servers via an Internal Network
2. To access the ILO/IPMI interfaces of the bare metal servers via the IPMI Network
3. To an overlay Bootstrapping Network to transfer the deployment and final images to the bare metal servers
In the setup, the first two networks were combined in a single subnet. 
For redundancy, two VSGs are combined in a Redundancy Group with MCLAG-interfaces connected to the Bare Metals  These were left out in the figures.

## Bare Metal boot up process

The workflow to boot a server dynamically to a tenant network can be described in following two steps

### Initial enrollment of the server as a node in Ironic

Each bare metal first has to be provisioned as an Ironic Node. This is an administrative task to ensure the Openstack Compute service sees the available hardware. After enrollment Ironic can use the IPMI interface of the bare metal server to power on/power off the machine and a user image can be transferred to the node. 
As part of the enrollment, properties such as boot method, switch network connection, IPMI address, etc. need to be provided.


### 1. Power up in Bootstrapping Network

The Ironic node will use the IPMI interface of a bare metal server to power on/power off the machine upon creation/deletion of a bare metal server. Initially, the bare metal server will be connected to a Bootstrapping Network. It will use PXE boot to get the deployment image from the Ironic node.  Once booted, the deployment image will download and install the final user image.

![Power up in bootstrap network][ironic-bootstrap-nw] 

### 2. Mapping to Final Overlay Network

Once the final image is installed, the bare metal server is disconnected from the Bootstrapping Network and connected to the final overlay network, which can also contain virtual machines, containers, WAN services and more.

# Ironic Integration steps with Nuage Networks VSP

To integrate OpenStack Ironic with Nuage Networks, following steps have to be followed:
1.  Preparation of Top-of-Rack switches
2.  Create Bootstrapping Network on OpenStack Controller
3.  Deploy Ironic Controller VM, incl creation of Ironic SQL Database
4.  Create Glance Disk Images and Nova Flavor
5.  Enroll an Ironic Node

## Preparation of Top-of-Rack switches
For a redundant connection from server to top-of-rack switches, the pair of VSG needs to be configured as Multi-Chassis Redundancy Group with MC-LAG towards a bonded interface on the Bare Metal node.
The _lag_ on the VSG needs to be configured with a `dynamic-service-profile` to allow being programmed by VSD.

### Configure dynamic service profile
A dynamic service profile needs to be assigned on all ports or lags that need to be programmed by VSD. 
In the context of `Ironic`, usually untagged traffic is expected, but for future-proofness, a full open vlan range will be used.

```
*A:VSG-361>config>service>dynamic-services# info
----------------------------------------------
            port-profile "access-ports" create
                vlan-range 0-4094 mode push create
                exit
                no shutdown
            exit
----------------------------------------------
```

The same profile should be configured on VSG2.
 
### Create the VSG redundancy group
Although not required, it is advised to configure two VSGs in a Multi-Chassis Redundancy Group for redundancy. 


Follow section *MultiChassis Link Aggregation Group*  of the Nuage Networks VSP User Guide to configure the VSGs. Create the needed lags in the VSD, but do not create the VLAN identifiers itself. This will be done by the Openstack services `Ã¬ronic` and  `neutron`.


### Configuring LACP fallback
In case of a redundancy group, LACP fallback is required. LACP fallback allows PXE boot by disabling one port of the lag if no LACP packets are received.
Assign a lower port priority number on the VSG that is connected to the PXE enabled interface, to assure this interface will be used.

Make sure to set the timeout low enough. The timer starts to run when the server boots. The LACP fallback timer should expire before the DHCP timeout on the server.

**VSG1 configuration**

```
*A:VSG-361# \configure lag 5
*A:VSG-361>config>lag# info
----------------------------------------------
        encap-type dot1q
        port 1/1/5 priority 1
        dynamic-service-profile access-ports
        lacp active administrative-key 32769
        lacp-fallback timeout 10
        no shutdown
---------------------------------------------- 
```

**VSG2 configuration**

```
*A:VSG-362# \configure lag 5
*A:VSG-362>config>lag# info
----------------------------------------------
        encap-type dot1q    
        port 1/1/5
        dynamic-service-profile access-ports
        lacp active administrative-key 32769
        lacp-fallback timeout 10
        no shutdown
----------------------------------------------
```

Following commands can be used for debugging. During PXE boot, LACP is in fallback mode
```
*A:VSG-361>config>lag# show lag 5 lacp-fallback

## Create Bootstrapping Network on Nuage VSD


The Bootstrapping Network is a simple network implemented as L2 domain that can be created on the OpenStack Controller or Nuage VSP. In this application note, we will use VSD Managed mode. The advantage of this is that ACLs or Security Groups are not configured automatically and do not consuem system resources on VSG.

![Creating a L2 domain in Nuage for the bootstrapping network][nuage-boostrap-nw]

Once created, you can make it available to Openstack admin project by using the UUID as `nuagenet` parameter:

```
neutron net-create provisioning_net
neutron subnet-create provisioning_net --name provisioning_subnet 10.0.0.0/24 --disable-dhcp --nuagenet d268e38b-493c-44d0-8829-4a501fb0f79d --net-partition OpenStack_default
```

The Ironic Controller has to be attached to this bootstrapping network. The simplest way is to create a VLAN (e.g. `0`) on the gateway port (e.g. `1/1/2`) which will connect the Ironic controller into this domain.

```
# grep the id of the provisioning subnet:
provisioning_subnet_id=`neutron subnet-list | grep provisioning_subnet | awk '{ print $2 }'`

 In the VSD, create a VLAN (0 in example below) on the gateway port which will connect the Ironic controller into the provisioning subnet. 

# From OpenStack, add this vlan id into the provisioning subnet. 
ironic_gateway_port=`neutron nuage-gateway-vlan-show --gateway 17.100.36.110 --gatewayport 1/1/2 0 | grep id | awk '{print $4}'`

neutron nuage-gateway-vport-create --tenant-id admin --subnet $provisioning_subnet_id $ironic_gateway_port
```

## Deploy Ironic Controller VM
The Ironic Controller can be deployed by following the instructions from
https://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/liberty/deploy/install-guide.html

In this application note, the Ironic Controller will be deployed on a Centos 7.3 VM, with 
* One interface to management network
* One interface via Linux bridge towards VSG

### Install Openstack release package
```
# Install the Centos repo (in case of RDO)
yum install centos-release-openstack-liberty
```

### Configure Keystone for Ironic Service

```
# Copy over keystonerc_admin from the OpenStack controller

keystone user-create --name=ironic --pass=<kspass> --email=ironic@example.com
keystone user-role-add --user=ironic --tenant=services --role=admin
keystone service-create --name=ironic --type=baremetal --description="Ironic bare metal provisioning service"
keystone endpoint-create \
--service-id=the_service_id_above \
--publicurl=http://IRONIC_NODE:6385 \
--internalurl=http://IRONIC_NODE:6385 \
--adminurl=http://IRONIC_NODE:6385 \
--region=RegionOne
```

### Install and configure OpenStack Ironic packages

For interworking between Nuage Networks and OpenStack Liberty, the upstream Ironic Packages had to be slightly patched by the Nuage team. As such gateway ports could be created on a per-tenant basis. 
For ease of installation, the Nuage Networks team have repackaged the Ironic components, so they could be installed with: 
```
yum localinstall openstack-ironic-common-*_nuage.noarch.rpm
yum localinstall openstack-ironic-api-*_nuage.noarch.rpm
yum localinstall openstack-ironic-conductor-*_nuage.noarch.rpm
yum localinstall nuage-ironic-nova-*.noarch.rpm
yum install python-ironicclient
```

Set following parameters in `ironic.conf`:
```
[DEFAULT]
provisioning_network = 4f85e24e-06fc-4bd9-858c-8c0abcd1f1c8
network_provider = nuage
auth_strategy=keystone

[database]
connection=mysql+pymysql://ironic:<mysql_pass>@127.0.0.1/ironic?charset=utf8
    
[dhcp]
dhcp_provider=none

[keystone_authtoken]
auth_uri = http://10.167.36.62:5000/v2.0
identity_uri = http://10.167.36.62:35357
admin_tenant_name = services
admin_user = ironic
admin_password = <kspass>

[neutron]
url=http://10.167.36.62:9696    

auth_strategy=keystone

cleaning_network_uuid=<provisioning_net>

[glance]
glance_host=10.167.36.62
glance_port=9292
glance_protocol=http
glance_api_insecure=True
auth_strategy=keystone
 
[oslo_messaging_rabbit]
rabbit_host = controller
rabbit_port = 5672
rabbit_hosts = controller:5672
rabbit_use_ssl = False
rabbit_userid = guest
rabbit_password = guest
rabbit_virtual_host = /
rabbit_ha_queues = False
heartbeat_rate=2
heartbeat_timeout_threshold=0
```

Cleaning is a configurable set of steps, such as erasing disk drives, that are performed on the node to ensure it is in a baseline state and ready to be deployed to. This is done after instance deletion, and during the transition from a "managed" to "available" state. Cleaning is enabled by default:

```
[conductor]
clean_nodes=true
```
### Install OpenStack Nova Compute component
The Ironic Conductor node also runs Nova Compute role since it is used as a scheduling input for any bare metal workloads.
``` 
yum install openstack-nova-compute  
```

Edit /etc/nova/nova.conf â These parameters must be configured on both controller and compute node:
```    
[DEFAULT]
compute_driver=nova.virt.ironic.IronicDriver
scheduler_host_manager=nova.scheduler.ironic_host_manager.IronicHostManager
compute_manager=ironic.nova.compute.manager.ClusteredComputeManager

monkey_patch=true
monkey_patch_modules=nova.compute.manager:nuage_ironic_nova.nova.compute.manager.decorator,nova.network.neutronv2.api:nuage_ironic_nova.nova.network.neutronv2.api.decorator

[ironic]
# Ironic keystone admin name
admin_username=ironic
admin_password=<kspass>
admin_url=http://10.167.36.62:35357/v2.0
admin_tenant_name=services
api_endpoint=http://10.167.36.63:6385/v1
``` 

### Installing DHCP server on Ironic Controller
```
yum -y install dhcp
```

Edit /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
```
default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

next-server 192.168.0.1;
filename "/pxelinux.0";

# this DHCP server to be declared valid
authoritative;
# specify network address and subnet mask
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
 # specify the range of lease IP address
 range dynamic-bootp 192.168.0.128 192.168.0.254;
 # specify broadcast address
 option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255;
}
```
Restart the dhcp server.
```
service dhcpd restart
``` 
### Installing TFTP server 

The Ironic Controller will also host a TFTP Server to enable the PXEBOOT process for any new Ironic Node. For further context, we refer here to the Newton guide as is more complete than the Liberty guide: https://docs.openstack.org/project-install-guide/baremetal/newton/setup-drivers.html

```
mkdir -p /tftpboot
chown -R ironic /tftpboot

sudo yum install tftp-server syslinux-tftpboot xinetd

vi /etc/xinetd.d/tftp

service tftp
{
  protocol        = udp
  port            = 69
  socket_type     = dgram
  wait            = yes
  user            = root
  server          = /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
  server_args     = -v -v -v -v -v --map-file /tftpboot/map-file /tftpboot
  disable         = no
  # This is a workaround for Fedora, where TFTP will listen only on
  # IPv6 endpoint, if IPv4 flag is not used.
  flags           = IPv4
}

systemctl restart xinetd

cp /boot/extlinux/chain.c32 /tftpboot

# Create map file
echo 're ^(/tftpboot/) /tftpboot/\2' > /tftpboot/map-file
echo 're ^/tftpboot/ /tftpboot/' >> /tftpboot/map-file
echo 're ^(^/) /tftpboot/\1' >> /tftpboot/map-file
echo 're ^([^/]) /tftpboot/\1' >> /tftpboot/map-file

cp -v /usr/share/syslinux/pxelinux.0 /tftpboot
cp -v /usr/share/syslinux/menu.c32 /tftpboot
cp -v /usr/share/syslinux/memdisk /tftpboot
cp -v /usr/share/syslinux/mboot.c32 /tftpboot
```

#### Setup PXE UEFI

```
sudo yum install grub2-efi shim

sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/centos/shim.efi /tftpboot/bootx64.efi
sudo cp /boot/efi/EFI/centos/grubx64.efi /tftpboot/grubx64.efi

GRUB_DIR=/tftpboot/EFI/centos
sudo mkdir -p $GRUB_DIR

cd $GRUB_DIR
vim grub.cfg

sudo chmod 644 $GRUB_DIR/grub.cfg

```

## Create Ironic SQL database
In this setup, the Ironic SQL database will be installed on the Ironic Controller to ensure full isolation from the rest of the Openstack services.
```
yum -y install mariadb-server mariadb

systemctl start mariadb
systemctl enable mariadb

mysql -e "CREATE DATABASE ironic CHARACTER SET utf8; "
mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ironic.* TO 'ironic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY â<mysql_pass>â;"
mysql -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ironic.* TO 'ironic'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY  '<mysql_pass>';"

# Create the database schema
ironic-dbsync --config-file /etc/ironic/ironic.conf create_schema
```

## Activate Ironic

After setting up the Ironic Controller VM, the Nova Scheduler has to be restarted and on the OpenStack controller, execute
```
service openstack-nova-scheduler restart
```

On Ironic compute, execute
``` 
service openstack-nova-compute restart
```

Note: After restarting the compute service, the nova logs can show following error: `No compute node record for host <ironic node>`.  This will be resolved after the enrollment process.


## Creating the Glance disk images and Bare Metal Nova Flavor

Given the end user will use Nova to boot his/her bare metal through Nova, a Glance disk image is required (supported by a kernel and initrd images). This will be referred to as `my-image`. 
Also an Ironic Python Agent Image is required to facilitate actions such as inspect, configure, clean and deploy images.

Detailed instructions are on https://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/liberty/deploy/install-guide.html#image-requirements and https://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/liberty/deploy/install-guide.html#building-or-downloading-a-deploy-ramdisk-image

### Create user image 

```
yum install diskimage-builder --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="centos-openstack-liberty"
mkdir diskimage; cd diskimage/

# A "devuser" with password "secret" on the image can be created for debugging.
export DIB_DEV_USER_USERNAME="devuser"
export DIB_DEV_USER_PASSWORD="secret" 
export DIB_DEV_USER_PWDLESS_SUDO="yes"
disk-image-create centos7 baremetal dhcp-all-interfaces grub2 devuser -o my-image

# Add the images to glance
glance image-create --name my-kernel --visibility public --disk-format aki --container-format aki < my-image.vmlinuz
kernel_id=`glance image-list | grep my-kernel | awk '{print $2}'`

glance image-create --name my-image.initrd --visibility public --disk-format ari --container-format ari  < my-image.initrd
ramdisk_id=`glance image-list | grep my-image.initrd | awk '{print $2}'`

glance image-create --name my-image --visibility public --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --property kernel_id=$kernel_id --property  ramdisk_id=$ramdisk_id  < my-image.qcow2
```

Note: In case of MC-LAG, the user image should have a LAG  with LACP configured. Creation of such an image is out of scope of this guide. 

### Create IPA deploy image 

The Ironic Python Agent used in this application note is the one supplied by TripleO project. For this, download `ironic-python-agent.tar` and `ironic-python-agent.tar.md5` from
https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/7/cloud/x86_64/tripleo_images/liberty/delorean/

Verify the checksum, unpack and run following commands to add them into glance. 
```
glance image-create --name deploy-vmlinuz --visibility public \
--disk-format aki --container-format aki < ironic-deploy.kernel
glance image-create --name deploy-initrd --visibility public \
--disk-format ari --container-format ari < ironic-deploy.initramfs

deploy_kernel=`glance image-list | grep deploy-vmlinuz | awk '{print $2}'`
deploy_ramdisk=`glance image-list | grep deploy-initrd | awk '{print $2}'`
```

### Create Nova Flavor 

Finally the Nova flavor has to be created as well:
```
nova flavor-create my-baremetal-flavor auto 1024 100 2  # 1024 Mb ram, 100 Gb disk and 2 CPU
nova flavor-key my-baremetal-flavor set cpu_arch=x86_64
```

# Enrollment process 

https://docs.openstack.org/developer/ironic/liberty/deploy/install-guide.html#enrollment

```
# test IPMI access
ipmitool -I lanplus -H 10.167.36.125 -U ADMIN -P ADMIN chassis power status
Chassis Power is on

# Create node, e.g for server6
ironic node-create -d pxe_ipmitool -n server6

# Enable UEFI 
ironic node-update server6 add properties/capabilities='boot_mode:uefi'

# Update flavor, ipmi address/username/password, and deploy images:
ironic node-update server6 add properties/cpus=2 properties/memory_mb=1024 properties/local_gb=100 properties/cpu_arch=x86_64 properties/capabilities="boot_option:local" driver_info/ipmi_address=10.167.36.126 driver_info/ipmi_username=ADMIN driver_info/ipmi_password=ADMIN driver_info/deploy_kernel=$deploy_kernel driver_info/deploy_ramdisk=$deploy_ramdisk

# create ironic port with MAC address of the PXE interface 
node_uuid=`ironic node-list | grep server6 | awk '{print $2}'`
ironic port-create -n $node_uuid -a 0c:c4:7a:0f:57:3c

# get UUID of this port
port_uuid=`ironic port-list | grep 0c:c4:7a:0f:57:3c | awk '{print $2}'`

# update this port with the right VSG (pair) port information
ironic port-update $port_uuid add extra/gateway_name=VSG-pair extra/gateway_port=lag-6 extra/gateway_vlan=0
```

# Boot Image
Finally, an image can be booted using a traditional Nova boot command, including options for the flavor and the desired tenant network it should be attached to:
```
# Boot image
nova boot BM.1 --image my-image --flavor my-baremetal-flavor --nic net-id=<uuid of final subnet>
```

During the process, we can see the new baremetal in the bootstrapping network
![Bare Metal as provisioned in the boostrap network][nuage-bootstrap-nw-with-bm]


After booting (this can take a while), you can verify the ironic node:
```
ironic node-validate server6
+------------+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

### Make sure the lag exists on the redundancy group
If not, you might get an index out of range error in nova-compute.log
Make sure the VLAN is not configured on this lag. This will be done by OpenStack.

### Node in error state 

Make sure the node is in available state

If the node is in error state, and you want to move it back to manageable, first change the state to deleted.

### Node stuck in bootstrap step

Remove the port in Openstack
* Ensure VPort, PolicyGropu and ACL in provisioning network are cleaned up
* Check Permissions on ACL
